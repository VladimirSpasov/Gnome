Tech Asessment

This is a test i've made for a tech asessmant givent to me as part of a selection proccess. I've used Alamofire and AlamofireObjectMapper to connect to the API  and parse the JSON response. Also i've used AlamofireImage for fetching the remote images. For the UI I've used a component called ElongationPreview by Ramotion because I realy like the look and feel of it. I've used MVC for this example and i've tryed to keep it clean and organised, even I'm sure it can be further improved.


P.S.: I found at the last moment that on iPhone 7 there are visual problems.
